## Technologies Used

**MongoDB** - MongoDB is used to hold user and post data on the backend of the application.

**Express** - Express is the Node framework that allows for the use of middleware functions in order to send user data, auth info, and post data between MongoDB and React.

**React** - React is the frontend library that renders the whole application as a single page. The single page functionality of React allows for a smooth UI when moving from one 'page' to another, as the application is not being re-rendered every time.

**Node**

**AWS S3**
